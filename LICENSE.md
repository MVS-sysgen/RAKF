* . . .
*
* Phil Roberts reconstructed Phil Dickinson's changes to the original
* ESG source through disassembly and compare.  Based on that source I
* finalized Phil D's work and now have RAKF fully working on MVS
* 3.8j.  I'm still in a final testing phase.  After having finished
* this, I'd like to post RAKF to the H390-MVS group and also to
* submit the changed  source back to CBT to avoid it getting lost
* again.  Before doing this, I'd like to ask for your consent as the
* original author.  As far as I understood Phil D asked for the same
* permission in 2005 but I don't want to just quietly take over from
* him.
