*
* . . .
*
* Phil Roberts reconstructed Phil Dickinson's changes to the original
* ESG source through disassembly and compare. Based on that source I
* finalized Phil D's work and now have RAKF fully working on MVS 3.8j.
* I'm still in a final testing phase. After having finished this, I'd
* like to post RAKF to the H390-MVS group and also to submit the changed
* source back to CBT to avoid it getting lost again. Before doing this,
* I'd like to ask for your consent as the original author. As far as I
* understood Phil D asked for the same permission in 2005 but I don't
* want to just quietly take over from him.
