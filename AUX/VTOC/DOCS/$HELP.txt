)O OPERANDS -
))'VOLUME-LIST'     - A VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER OR A LIST OF VOLUMES.
              IF THE FIRST ONE TO FIVE CHARACTERS OF A VOLUME
              SERIAL NUMBER ARE ENTERED, ALL VOLUMES THAT ARE
              MOUNTED ON THE MACHINE WHICH START WITH THOSE
              CHARACTERS WILL BE LISTED.
              IF 'ALL' IS SPECIFIED, ALL NON-VIRTUAL VOLUMES
              WHICH ARE ONLINE AND READY WILL BE PROCESSED.
              IF 'ALV' IS SPECIFIED, ALL VIRTUAL VOLUMES
              WHICH ARE ONLINE AND READY WILL BE PROCESSED,
              IF THEY ARE MOUNTED PRIVATE/RESERVED OR
              PRIVATE/RESIDENT.
))LEVEL('DSNAME-START')  - SPECIFIES THE HIGH LEVEL QUALIFIERS TO BE
         SEARCHED.  THIS WILL NOT BE PREFIXED BY YOUR USERID OR
         PREFIX.  ONLY DATA SETS STARTING WITH THESE PREFIXES WILL
         BE LISTED.
))CONTAINING('DSNAME-STRING') - SPECIFIES A CHARACTER STRING CONTAINED
         IN THE DATA SET NAME.  AT LEAST ONE OF THE STRINGS MUST
         BE IN THE DSNAME FOR THE DATA SET TO BE LISTED.
         THESE STRINGS MUST CONFORM TO DSNAME STANDARDS.
         THEY CANNOT BEGIN WITH A PERIOD OR A NUMBER.
))ENDING('DSNAME-END')  - SPECIFIES THE ENDING CHARACTERS OF THE
         DSNAME.  THE FINAL NONBLANK CHARACTERS OF THE DSNAME MUST
         BE ONE OF THESE STRINGS TO ALLOW THE DATA SET TO BE LISTED.
         THESE STRINGS MUST CONFORM TO DSNAME STANDARDS.
))CAT      -  A LOCATE IS DONE FOR EACH DSNAME ON THE VOLUMES LISTED
         AND STATUS IS INDICATED.  NOTE -  THIS OPTION USES A
         CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF PROCESSING TIME.
         C -  CATALOGGED ON THIS VOLUME
         N -  NOT CATALOGGED
         W -  CATALOGGED ON ANOTHER VOLUME
         E -  CATALOG PROCESSING ERROR
))NOSORT   -  THE DATA SETS ARE NOT SORTED.  THEY ARE OUTPUT AS THEY
              ARE FOUND.
))SORT('SORT-FIELDS') DATA SETS ARE SORTED INTO ALPHABETICAL ORDER,
              BASED UPON THE SORT FIELDS SPECIFIED.
              DSNAME,VOLUME,ALLOC,USED,UNUSED,PCT,EX,DSO,RFM,
              LRECL,BLKSZ,CDATE,EXPDT,REFDT ARE VALID SORT FIELDS.
              'A/D'   ARE REQUIRED AFTER EACH SORT FIELD TO INDICATE
              ASCENDING/DESCENDING SEQUENCE.
))BREAK('BREAK-CHARS') - THE LISTING WILL CONTAIN A NEW HEADER,
              ( ON A NEW PAGE IF THE VTOCOUT DD CARD OPTION IS USED ),
              WHENEVER THE SPECIFIED NUMBER OF CHARACTERS DIFFERS
              FROM THE PRECEDING DATA SET.  THIS OPTION FUNCTIONS
              ONLY WITH THE SORT OPTION.
))CHARS('CHARS-PER-LINE') - SPECIFIES THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS ON EACH
              LINE OF OUTPUT.  THE DEFAULT IS 150 FOR PRINT AND THE
              LINESIZE OF THE TERMINAL FOR TSO SESSIONS.
              YOU CAN GET MORE INFORMATION BY SPECIFYING A LARGER
              NUMBER OF CHARACTERS PER LINE OR YOU CAN LIMIT THE
              PRINTING BY SETTING A SMALLER NUMBER OF CHARACTERS
              PER LINE OF OUTPUT.
))LINES('LINES-PER-PAGE') - SPECIFIES THE NUMBER OF LINES BEFORE A NEW
              TITLE LINE IS PRODUCED.  IT DEFAULTS TO 60 FOR PRINT
              AND TO THE SCREEN SIZE FOR TSO SESSIONS.
))NOHEADING   - DO NOT PRODUCE A HEADING.  THE HEADING WILL ONLY BE
              OUTPUT IF THE VTOCOUT DD STATEMENT IS PRESENT.
))HEADING('TEXT') - IF A DD STATEMENT WITH A DDNAME OF VTOCOUT IS
              PRESENT, THIS TEXT WILL BE USED TO BEGIN EVERY PAGE.
              CARRIAGE CONTROL SHOULD BE INCLUDED ( ASA ).  THE
              DEFAULT HEADER CONSISTS OF VTOC COMMAND VERSION 02
              AND THE COMMAND THAT WAS ENTERED.
))DSNLEN('LENGTH') - SPECIFIES THE LENGTH OF THE DSNAME TO PRINT.
              THE REST OF THE DSNAME IS TRUNCATED.  THE CHARS PARAMETER
              WILL ALSO CAUSE THE DSNAME TO BE TRUNCATED, IF THE NAME
              AND THE PRECEDING INFORMATION EXCEEDS THE PRINT LINE.
))NOPRINT     - SPECIFIES THAT INDIVIDUAL ITEMS ARE NOT TO BE LISTED.
              THE COMMAND CAN BE USED TO CALCULATE TOTALS.
))PRINT('PRINT-OP' ('PRINT-ITEM-LIST')) -
              SPECIFIES THE ITEMS TO PRINT.  THE 'PRINT-OP' IS THE
              OPERATION TO BE DONE.  THEY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.
                NEW - THE 'PRINT-ITEM-LIST' IS A COMPLETE LIST OF WHAT
                      TO PRINT.
                REP - THE FIRST 'PRINT-ITEM' WILL BE REPLACED WITH THE
                      REST OF THE ITEMS ON THE LIST.
                ADD - THE REST OF THE 'PRINT-ITEM-LIST' WILL BE ADDED
                      AFTER THE FIRST ITEM ON THE LIST.
                DEL - THE ITEMS ON THE 'PRINT-ITEM-LIST' WILL NOT BE
                      PRINTED.
              THE 'PRINT-ITEM-LIST' NAMES ARE THE SAME KEYWORDS USED
              IN LIM, AND, AND OR FUNCTIONS AND ARE ALSO THE TITLES
              AS PRINTED.
              THE ADD, DEL, AND REP PRINT OPERATIONS REFER TO THE
              DEFAULT PRINT LIST.  THE DEFAULT LIST IS ALLOC, UNUSED,
              PCT, EX, DSO, RFM, BLKSZ, LRECL, REFDT, CDATE, VOLUME,
              DSNAME, EXPDT, SECQ, SECT, ROUND, PASS, ACTION,
              AND TYPE.  AS NOTED UNDER CHARS ABOVE, ONLY THE ITEMS
              THAT WILL FIT ON THE PRINT LINE WILL BE LISTED.
))LIMIT('VALUE' 'OPER' 'KEYWORD') - SPECIFIES WHICH DATA SETS ARE TO
              BE LISTED.  ONLY DATA SETS THAT SATISFY THE RELATION
              ARE LISTED.
))'KEYWORD'   - IS THE NAME OF A DATA SET FIELD.  THE LIST OF CURRENTLY
                PROVIDED FIELDS FOLLOWS.  THE KEYWORDS AND THEIR VALUES
                ARE THE SAME AS IN THE VTOC OUTPUT.
